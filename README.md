# UC Irvine CS178 Project

This repository is for the final Project of the CS178 Machine Learning class (UC Irvine, Winter 2017).

The project is a class wide Kaggle competition on predicting rainfall from some satellite data. 

The final predition model is an weighted ensemble of multiple learners (Linear Regression, KNN, Neural Network, Random Forest, etc..). Our best result ended up in top 5% of the class.
